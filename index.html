                    Amy Lee was born on December 13, 1981 in Riverside, California, to parents John Lee, who worked as a disc jockey and voice-over artist, and Sara Cargill. The oldest of five siblings, she has two living sisters. Lee had a younger sister who died at age three from an unidentified illness when Lee was six years old, and a younger brother who died in 2018 at age 24 after struggling with severe epilepsy for most of his life. Lee said that when her little sister died, her "whole perception of life changed." Lee discovered a passion for the piano in early childhood. Classical music was her first musical influence as a child, inspiring her to become a musician and composer. She was first inspired by Mozart when she watched the 1984 film Amadeus at nine years old. Beethoven was another early classical inspiration, as well as Danny Elfman's film scores.[17][20] She wanted to take piano lessons, and studied classical piano for nine years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Lee">Original copy source</a> </p>

                    Lee, along with friend "Moody" co-founded Evanescence in 1995. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence, which means "disappearance" or "fading away".What made Lee want to start a band was "the idea of combinations that were unlikely". With Evanescence, Lee aimed to combine her different musical tastes, "bringing something from the cinematic and classical symphonic world and marrying it to metal, hard rock and alternative music." "There was all this music that was inspiring me. And Evanescence was the product of these two extremes combining" Their debut album Fallen was released in 2003. Most of Lee's writing on the album was inspired by an abusive relationship she was in. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Lee">Original copy source</a>

                    Lee later stated that the creation of Fallen largely consisted of her and Moody writing music separately and then adding to each other's work, due to tension and significant creative differences between them. Lee and Moody composed some of the songs on Fallen when they were 15 and 16.In 2003, Lee stated she had opposed the label's initial promotion of the band in the Christian market, which Moody had originally supported and misrepresented the band. She said that Evanescence was not a Christian band and lyrically never had a religious affiliation.They eventually recorded three EPs: Evanescence EP (1998), of which about 100 copies were made and distributed at their early live performances; Sound Asleep EP (1999), also known as the Whisper EP; and Mystary EP (2003) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Lee">Original copy source</a>

                    During Evanescence's hiatus in 2013, Lee embarked on her film score career by composing the soundtrack to War Story with Dave Eggar, which led to the release of the soundtrack album Aftermath (2014) and promotional single "Lockdown". Aftermath reached number 47 on Billboard 200.[5] In 2015, Lee and Eggar teamed up again with Chuck Palmer on the score for Indigo Grey: The Passage, which won Best Film Score at the Moondance International Film Festival.
